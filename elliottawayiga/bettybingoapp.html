                            An affinity map was assembled based on the notes from the studies.
                            The feedbacks were then synthesis to form an affinity diagram of themes and opportunities.
                            11 key features were Ideated based on the affinity diagram and prioritized

                        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                        <p>I make use of user testing to explore potential solutions during the design process or test
                        the waters during the product design cycle. Watching users try to accomplish tasks on
                        early prototypes is the most effective and efficient way to uncover usability problems.

                        <p> our validation testing, the feature to include various payment
                        options and allow users to access their user account detailsworked very well with over
                        85% of the users strongly agreed it will
                        add value and increase accessibility.
                        The idea to include a notification feature to enable know when a
                        game is about to start has gain a positive response of 90% from
                        users.
                        During the first usabilty testing, 70% of users were not able to
                        navigate to their account details and tried editing their username
                        and password which resulted to the iteration of the user flow
                        and another test was run. The second test showed a postive
                        result with 90% of the user finding it easy to navigate to their user
                        account.
                        The inclusion of chatroom had 40% of the result as well which led
                        us to believe that these feature wont add much value for user and
                        increase accessibility and engagement but can be a feature to be
                        considered in the future once users are familiar with the app.
                        We are still in the design phase and we are sure to test with our
                        various user types and also Software Engineers, from which we’ll
                        continue to iterate to give the best experince to our users.</p>

                        <h3>Solution and Impact Overview</h3>
                        <p>Our solution allowed for users to make payment into their
                        account with multiple payment options available to them and
                        having it reflected in the account instantly. This has increase
                        user engagement by 80% and added more value to user
                        experience on the app.
                        The easy navigation to users account and user being able to
                        change their usernames and password has increased users
                        engagement by 65%.</p>
