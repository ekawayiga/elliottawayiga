                        <p>The e-zwich payment system provides payments services from the government to national service
                            personnel, pensioners, NABCO trainers, teachers and nurses trainers and some other groups of
                            employees. Some of its users privately and publicly expressed negative opinions about the
                            e-zwich services.

                            These views suggest that, their services are frustrating to use and that it imposes a poor
                            experience on customers. Some have claimed this as the main reason why they stopped using
                            their
                            cards immediately after their national service or withdraw their money and redeposit it into
                            another bank after they receive payment on the cards from their various employers.

                            Therefore, we make sure they are 100% involve in the design process from empathizing with
                            users through conducting user research, surveys, build user personas, user journey, to
                            defining the need of the user, ideating possible solutions using the various techniques such
                            as; competitive analysis, crazy 8 etc, to prototyping the ideas generated and conducting
                            usability studies to test our early prototypes with our target users for the team to be able
                            to develop a highly usable and accessible product wit the user always in mind.

                            needs, and motivations through observation and feedbacks by priritizing the user of our
                            product. Conducting reserach helped us brige the gap between what we as a business thinks
                            the user needs and what actually the user need by building user personas, crafting user
                            stories, and building user journey maps to help us understand and humanize our target users.

                            started to personify our target users. Personas are fictional users whose goals and
                            characteristics represents the needs of a larger group of users. We created persona that
                            represent each group of users with similar characteristics that we have learned about from
                            through our research.
                            Personas are key to the design process because they reflect the lifestyle of users and give
                            us an idea of how to meet users needs and the challenges we are trying to solve for them.

                                spent some time to think about how our design meets these needs. A value proposition is
                                reason why a consumer should use our product that we are building. This is for us to
                                ensure that the user have a reason to use our app that we are creating as opposed to any
                                other competition app available.
                                In other to come up with a strong value proposition we asked ourselves these questions;
                            </p>

                            <p>We know that it's important to come up with lots of ideas before deciding on one
                                solution. A competitive audit is just one of the tools to explore ideas for our designs,
                                so we can learn from others or our competitors about what has worked and not worked for
                                them.
                                We start by identifying some of our key direct and indirect competitors in the space
                                that we are targeting, reviewed their product offers, and examined what they do well and
                                what they could do better and also consider how they talk about themselves. Using this
                                tool helped the team identified the gaps in the market and how we can address these gaps
                                through our app.</p>

                            <h5>How Might We</h5>
                            <p class="main-statement">After conducting our competitive analysis, the team believed we
                                have to generate more ideas so we decided to use another ideation technique called “How
                                Might We?”. Here, the team used the how might to translate the problems we identified
                                into opportunities for design.
                                The word "how" encourages us to explore a bunch of ideas instead of moving forward with
                                only one idea for the solution.
                                The word "how" suggests that we don't have an answer yet.
                                The word "might" emphasizes that our ideas are possible solutions, not the only
                                solution.
                                Finally, the word "we" suggests a collaborative effort. Coming up with ideas requires
                                teamwork.
                                So with our problem statement, one of our how might we statement reads; How Might We
                                design a solution for Sika to get access to the fund in her E-zwich account easy and

                            <p>The Crazy Eights exercise is a great way to get ideas flowing for any design problem you
                                need to solve. With Crazy Eights, we sketch eight different designs, each with a new
                                idea for solving the user’s problem. The best part? It only takes eight minutes!

                                Using the crazy 8 ideation technique is a bit of the fun part with our ideation process
                                because it involve a bit of sketching. With this technique, the team sketched solutions
                                that each member assumed could be a way our problems we identified can be resolve. Crazy
                                Eights lets us compare ideas, see everyone's different ideas and narrow down the list of
                                ideas before moving on with the best solutions. This is a bit “crazy” because each
                                member in the team has only one minute to spend on each idea and we have to generate
                                eight ideas each within eight minutes. </p>

                                name suggests, wireframes look like they were created with wires. They're mostly lines
                                and shapes with some text. So why do UX designers create wireframes? Wireframes
                                establish the basic structure of a page. before any visual considerations, like color or
                                images, are added. Wireframes serve as an outline to get the team on the same page early
                                in the project. How do I organize information on the page in a way that makes sense for
                                users and also highlight the intended function of the product</p>

                            <p>Since making changes to a high fidelity mockups can be a very difficult task, we decided
                                to conducted our usability test with our target users with our low fidelity prototype to
                                see how they interact with our solution to the problem that we are trying to solve. By
                                doing this exercise we were able to determine how easy it is for the user to complete a
                                core task in our product.
                            </p>

                            <p>During the study we observed the participants interact with the app to see how they
                                complete the task.
                                Then we used the insights from our study to make improvement to our designs. This study
                                was a moderated usability study and we asked questions to get more understanding of how
                                they interact with the app by completing tasks assigned to them.</p>

                            <p>After making these changes to improve the app based on the insights from the study, the
                                team decided to conduct one last study with the user but this time with the high
                                fidelity prototype. This helped us identified some usabilty and accessibility issues
                                with the choice of color and typography.</p>
